# Leetcoding Challenge

This repository has been created while I solve different Leetcoding Challenges which can be seen as follows.
* May - https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/may-leetcoding-challenge/
* June - https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/
* July - https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/

* October - https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/october-leetcoding-challenge/
This repository has been divided according to months.

Leetcoding challenges for me about *consistency and variety*!
* **Consistency** - Since they come up everyday
* **Variety** - Since they come up with all sorts of questions.

And so this repository also demonstrates those attributes of mine, that I'm a strong believer that *consistently working on anything builds your strength and skills*, and I also really *appreciate variety, whether it be a variety of approaches, a variety of technologies etc.* I would also like to throw light on the fact that I'm well acquainted with a variety of data structures and algorithms that helps me get through these challenges!
That was why I especially like Leetcoding challenges and maintain a repository for it.

You're welcome to have a look at my code, you might wanna see how it improves over time or might wanna see how a prticular question is solved (In that case if you're reading this, refrain from copy-pasting and try to understand the approach and learn a new technique).
Feel free to raise an issue if you find something just doesn't look right or have doubts anywhere!
